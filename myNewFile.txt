I may be far, but never gone.
Working hard is important. But there is something that matters, even more, believing in yourself.
Everything that has been done There is always a reason for it.
It does not dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
I like the moon, but I canâ€™t reach it Like you I can only see.
I pretend to look around, but I was actually looking at you.
